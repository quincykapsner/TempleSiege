# TempleSiege
CS583 2D Game

**Extracted game and submission video under Finished folder**

Notes about the game that are hard to show in the video:
- Game over screen has a pool of different messages to draw from based on what you lost to
- Enemies summoned are semi-randomized (restricted by how far along the game is)
- The random loud noise is because the statue hit 20% health
- Blue and dark green orcs do more damage and have more health
- Dialogue in the tutorial can be skipped using the button or spacebar

Changes from one pager:
- Spacebar does not do an attack, only right click. 
- No background music (by request) 
- No horn blast for the start of another wave or game over music 

I don't have a scripts folder so here's how to find all of them:
- Go to Assets folder
- Some scripts are here (mostly game managing ones)
- 1 script in Interfaces folder
- Go to Characters folder
- Some scripts in here
- Each folder in Characters has scripts for that entity type
